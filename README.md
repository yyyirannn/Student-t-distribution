# Student-t-distribution
Using the rt command in R, simulate 10000 observations from a student t distribution with the degree of freedom equal to 5. Do the same thing for t distributions  with degrees of freedom equal to 20 and 100 respectively. Calculate the means and  standard deviations of the three samples. Standardize all three samples to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, to compare the extent of deviation from normality.
